This project describes an accounting system. This system allows tracking expenses. The main functions of the system are:

Adding an expense. The user specifies the date, amount, and category.
Managing categories. The user can add and delete categories. Categories that have expenses cannot be deleted.
Generating reports. The user can generate expense reports for various time intervals and categories. For example, expenses for all categories per month over the past year.
All data is saved in a file.

Currently, the system has a console interface.

In the future, the project will be expanded with the integration of a database and further developed using Spring Boot libraries.
